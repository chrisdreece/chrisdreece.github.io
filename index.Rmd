title: "Mild Covid-19 Causes Brain Damage"

## A Summary of The Evidence

As the delta variant of COVID-19 spreads and infects a growing number of fully vaccinated people, many vaccinated individuals take comfort in the fact that a breakthrough infection is likely to be mild. However, a mild COVID-19 infection is still quite risky. A growing body of evidence suggests that **a mild case of COVID-19 is likely to cause permanent brain damage,** including: 

* Long-term cognitive impairment
* Memory problems
* Damage to senses of smell and taste
* Increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease

For many of us, this evidence is hard to accept and does not match our experience. Most of us know someone who has recovered from a mild COVID-19 infection and reports no lingering symptoms. But even in these cases, damage may have occured -- the neurological impact of this virus is often mild enough to be imperceptible to the individual, at least initially.^[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ene.14775]. 

Still, though these effects may be subtle, they are measurable and consequential -- people who've had mild COVID-19 perform worse on cognitive tests and show patterns of brain tissue loss that appear "strikingly similar to those associated with Alzheimerâ€™s disease or other forms of dementia,"^[https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210618/Alarming-COVID-study-indicates-long-term-loss-of-gray-matter-and-other-brain-tissue.aspx] leading researchers to predict a coming epidemic of dementia among COVID-19 survivors.

## Study #1

[Brain imaging before and after COVID-19 in UK Biobank](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.11.21258690v1)

* **Sample Population**: 394 COVID-19 survivors (most had mild cases) and 379 healthy controls
* **Method**: Brain scans conducted pre- and post-infection
* **Finding**: COVID-19, including mild cases, accelerates tissue deterioration in several regions of the brain
* **Media Coverage**:

## Study #2

[Cognitive deficits in people who have recovered from COVID-19 relative to controls](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.20.20215863v1)

* **Sample Population**: 84,285 Britons
* **Method**: Intelligence test
* **Finding**: COVID-19 survivors--included those who'd had mild cases--performed worse on intelligence tests compared to healthy controls
* **Media Coverage**:

## Study #3

[Cognitive decline among individuals with history of mild symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ene.14775)

* **Sample Population**: 93 Villagers in Atahualpa, Peru; 52 survivors of mild COVID-19 and 41 healthy controls
* **Method**: Cognitive assessments and brain scans
* **Finding**: Survivors of mild COVID-19 were 18 times more likely to exhibit cognitive decline

## Study #4

[Frequent neurocognitive deficits after recovery from mild COVID-19](https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/2/2/fcaa205/5998660)

* **Sample Population**: 18 adults, mostly young adults, who had recovered from mild-to-moderate COVID-19
* **Method**: Cognitive assessments
* **Finding**: 78% of COVID-19 patients performed poorly on cognitive tests, compared to healthy controls. "Our results demonstrate that sustained sub-clinical cognitive impairments might be a common complication after recovery from COVID-19 in young adults."

## Study #5

[The landscape of cognitive function in recovered COVID-19 patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324344/)

* **Sample Population**: 29 recovered COVID-19 patients at Zhejiang University School of Medicine 
* **Method**: Cognitive assessments
* **Finding**: "Our findings indicated that cognitive impairments exist even in patients recovered from COVID-19."
