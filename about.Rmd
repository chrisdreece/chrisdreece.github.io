I think the evidence I've summarized speaks for itself, but if it helps you to take me seriously, I'm a full-time Data Scientist with a Master's in Statistics from the Wharton School, and a PhD in Sociology from the University of Pennsylvania. I don't do much social media but you can find me on [linkedin.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisreecesociology/)
